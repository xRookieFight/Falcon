## What is this?

Falcon is a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server built from the ground up in C++17. It does not derive
from any existing server: the protocol, world storage, inventory, movement and gameplay systems are
all reimplemented by hand.

- **Native C++17** — no runtime to install, the server ships as a single self-contained executable
- **Own RakNet implementation** — sockets, reliability layer and connection handshake written here
- **NetherNet transport** — WebRTC signaling and transport, running alongside RakNet
- **Vanilla-like world generation** — noise, density functions, aquifers, caves, biomes and features
- **Behavior pack support** — custom items, blocks, actors and recipes loaded from packs, with a
  QuickJS scripting engine running pack scripts
- **Layered architecture** — network, protocol and server concerns stay separate

## Features

**World**

- LevelDB persistence using the Bedrock key layout, including block entities and pending changes
- Overworld generation with 3D biomes, aquifers, ore veins, caves and surface materials
- Chunk generation *and* population run on worker threads, never on the tick thread
- Chunk streaming ordered by field of view then distance, with reference counted unloading
- Sky light, daylight detector, weather with persistence, and a `dofiretick` game rule

## Building

Falcon needs CMake 3.16+, a C++17 compiler, zlib and OpenSSL. On Windows the reference toolchain is
MSYS2 UCRT64.

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```
